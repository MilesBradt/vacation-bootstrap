          <p class="bg-danger">Adventure and Alaska go hand in hand. Where else can you hike an ice-age glacier, skim over the wilderness in a bush plane, watch a massive brown bear snag a salmon from a waterfall or explore millions of acres of pristine parklands?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-4">
          <p>And don’t forget the water sports: Alaska's many famous rivers, lakes and protected coastal waters offer adventures that range from whitewater raft-ing (mild to wild), kayaking through fields of icebergs and glacier-carved fjords or snorkeling the near-coast waters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-4">
          <p>Alaska's raw, beautiful and unrelenting terrain teems with opportunities for backcountry experiences unlike anything else in the world—and there's a trip to suit every ability level. Not too comfortable with the great outdoors but still want a little adventure? Day excursions and guided tours allow you to discover the Alaska wilderness during the day and still sleep in a comfortable bed at night.</p>
